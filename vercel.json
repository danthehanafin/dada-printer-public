### What to Do Next (The Final Deployment)

You are on the final step. This will resolve the CORS error for good.

**Step 1: Add the New File to Your Project**

1.  Copy the code from the `Vercel Configuration` file in the Canvas above.
2.  On your Mac, open your `dada-printer-public` folder.
3.  Create a **new file** in the main `dada-printer-public` folder (at the same level as your `api` folder) and name it **`vercel.json`**.
4.  Paste the code you copied into this new file and save it.

Your final folder structure should now look like this:

```
dada-printer-public/
├── api/
│   └── server.js
└── vercel.json   <-- The new file you just added
